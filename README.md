# That's a do(n) dada.

_ !!! Experimental !!! _

At the time of this writing, I'm using this repo to test different set-ups for shell environments. Looking at ...

- display & [ frame ] [ window ] [ pane] targets / management
- log-ins & remote connections
- nesting rules ( e.g., tmux :: emacs :: eshell : zsh )

At the outset of the project, I'm using

- ZSH 5.0.2
- GNU Emacs 25.1 && 24.5
- tmux 1.9

Myriad more creditworthy configuration frameworks successfully manage 'dot files' and excel at plugging/extending shells and editors.

I always appreciate the finesse it takes to lead a live demo or create a screencast that is as viewable as it is illuminating. Thank you,
